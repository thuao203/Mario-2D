During my fourth year at the University of Science and Technology, the University of Danang, Vietnam, I developed a 2D Mario game featuring an intro screen, immersive sound effects, and selectable levels. This project has allowed me to enhance my skills in game development, level design, and performance optimization in Unity. While I focused on programming, I greatly appreciate the various resources that inspired the game's UI/UX design, sound effects, and intro elements, which contributed to creating a more engaging experience.
